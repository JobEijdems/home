  title: Ontola.io - Linked Data Software Development
  description: We specialize in developing semantic web applications.
  hero: We help you transform data into linked data.
  linked_data:
    title: linked data
    header: Upgrade your data quality
    body: Not all data is created equal. Linked data is the most reusable, structured and standardized way to store information. Save costs, increase accessibility and prevent issues. There are good reasons for why it’s also known as 5 ★ data.
    body_2: We'd love to help you realize your linked data ambitions.

  ontology_modelling:
    title: ontology modelling
    header: Open up and connect your data models
    body: The accuracy and compatibility of your data model determines how much value you can extract from it. The ontology is the open model backbone of linked data. Having a machine readable, well-standardized ontology enables us to generate documentation, interfaces, data validation tools and much more.
    body_2: We help you find or design the best ontology or vocabulary for your information.

  data_infrastructure:
    title: data infrastructure
    header: Break open your data silos
    body: Prevent costly vendor lock-in and API hell by storing your data in a linked data warehouse. Access all information through a uniform, W3C compliant, linked data API.
    body_2: We can help you improve your data strategy and set up a reliable, flexible and secure infrastrucure.

  web_development:
    title: web development
    header: A powerful back-end needs a powerful front-end
    body: Your data should not only be stored; it should be used. We specialize in developing interactive linked data systems, where users create and edit resources. Our frontend applications adapt their views to changes in your data model.
    body_2: We have many years of experience building easy to use front-end applications on pure linked data back-ends.

  projects:
    title: Some of our projects
    ori:
      title: Open Raadsiformatie
      body: Open Raadsinformatie collects meeting data from over 100 Dutch local governments and converts everything to linked open data, accessible through a uniform API and search engine. This project is a collaboration between the VNG, the Open State Foundation and us.
    link:
      title: Link-Lib / Link-Redux
      body: We've developed Link as a set of open source libraries for front-end web applications. They help to fetch, store, access and ultimately render linked data. The built-in reasoner helps to find the best fitting view for new types of data.
    rdf_serializers:
      title: RDF Serializers
      body: We’ve developed an open source library for serializing linked data with the popular framework Ruby On Rails. It serializes to RDF/XML, Turtle, N3, N-triples and JSON-LD.
    argu:
      title: Argu
      body: Argu is an e-democracy platform that makes decision making processes more interactive and transparent. It is designed to facilitate civil, structured discussions, voting procedures and online brainstorming to find solutions to problems. All data on Argu is accessible as linked data through its intuitive REST API.
  how_we_work:
    header: How we work
    one:
      title: Listen & understand
      body: Good consultancy starts with listening carefully. Together with you, we will look at your data sources and discuss how they are used. Whether you want to start with a small linked data pilot project or transition to a full-stack linked data warehouse, we will help you find the best way to realize your goal.
    two:
      title: Find or design an ontology
      body: Linked data is all about standardization. Using an existing model, standard, vocabulary or taxonomy makes your data more reusable, so we will help you find existing ontologies that work for you. If such an open model does not yet exist, we can help you design a fitting ontology. We'll make sure your ontology matches your data and works for your use cases. We use international W3C standards, such as SHACL, RDFs and OWL to describe your domain.
    three:
      title: Extract, transform, load
      body: We’ll set up an ETL architecture that imports your data, whether that’s a data dump, an existing application API, or anything else. All will be converted into linked data. Our ETL structure works event-driven, so we can easily set up a notification service, push messaging
    four:
      title: Software development
      body: "We build systems that make it really easy to modify and view your linked data. Whether you need an intuitive web interface or a custom made machine interface: we’ve got you covered. We're experienced full stack developers who build both backends and frontends. We know how to work with Ruby (on Rails), Javascript, Node, Typescript, Python, HTML, CSS, Docker, Continuous Integration and more."
    five:
      title: Publish
      body: All your data can be made accessible and editable through a RESTful Hypermedia API that serializes to JSON, JSON-LD, N3, N-Triples, CSV, RDF/XML and more. We can make everything searchable and queryable with Cypher, SPARQL, GRAPHQL and ElasticSearch. You set read / write permissions, we make sure only the right people and systems can access your data.

  hero: Improve your software development process
  title: Continuous integration advice
  intro: We help you reduce costs and optimize your software development workflow. Prevent bugs, release features more quickly and receive customer feedback earlier.
  build:
    title: build
    header: Build Automation
    body: Automate software compilation and reduce server maintenance and devops costs. Make sure that exceptions are caught automatically, so developers can learn about issues as quick as possible. Use containers to scale up your online service in minutes instead of days. Use a single environment for develop, test en production. Easily connect to hundreds of services and data centers.
  test:
    title: test
    header: Test Automation
    body: After automating the compilation process, you can do the same for testing. Discover bugs as soon as possible with test automation. Deploy only code which passes all tests. This way, you can guarantee that features will keep on working. With automated tests, programming becomes more fun and producive, since you can make changes to your code with confidence.
  integrate:
    title: integrate
    header: Continuous Integration
    body: Instead of waiting for release day, all developers merge their changes as quickly as possible to the master branch. This merged code is tested automatically. This makes software development more quick and enhances stability. By sharing more code, there is less friction in your development team.
  deliver:
    title: deliver
    header: Continuous Delivery
    body: Releasing a new version becomes as easy as pressing a button. The road from idea to realized feature is shorter than ever. A short value cycle is valuable for you and for your customers.
  deploy:
    title: deploy
    header: Continuous Deployment
    body: Releasing a new version is fully automated. Changes to code trigger a process that builds your software, tests it and releases it if it passes. Now your value cycle is even shorter.
  us:
    header: How we can help
    body: We can offer advice and consultancy to improve your software development workflow. We can train development teams to make their workflow more efficient.
