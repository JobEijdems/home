  how_we_work:
    header: How we work
    one:
      title: Listen & understand
      body: Good consultancy starts with listening carefully. Together with you, we will look at your data sources and discuss how they are used. Whether you want to start with a small linked data pilot project or transition to a full-stack linked data warehouse, we will help you find the best way to realize your goal.
    two:
      title: Find or design an ontology
      body: Linked data is all about standardization. Using an existing model, standard, vocabulary or taxonomy makes your data more reusable, so we will help you find existing ontologies that work for you. If such an open model does not yet exist, we can help you design a fitting ontology. We'll make sure your ontology matches your data and works for your use cases. We use international W3C standards, such as SHACL, RDFs and OWL to describe your domain.
    three:
      title: Extract, transform, load
      body: We’ll set up an ETL architecture that imports your data, whether that’s a data dump, an existing application API, or anything else. All will be converted into linked data. Our ETL structure works event-driven, so we can easily set up a notification service, push messaging
    four:
      title: Software development
      body: "We build systems that make it really easy to modify and view your linked data. Whether you need an intuitive web interface or a custom made machine interface: we’ve got you covered. We're experienced full stack developers who build both backends and frontends. We know how to work with Ruby (on Rails), Javascript, Node, Typescript, Python, HTML, CSS, Docker, Continuous Integration and more."
    five:
      title: Publish
      body: All your data can be made accessible and editable through a RESTful Hypermedia API that serializes to JSON, JSON-LD, N3, N-Triples, CSV, RDF/XML and more. We can make everything searchable and queryable with Cypher, SPARQL, GRAPHQL and ElasticSearch. You set read / write permissions, we make sure only the right people and systems can access your data.

  hero: Automate your software development process
  short: Continuous integration
  title: Continuous integration advice
  intro: We can help you reduce costs and optimize your software development workflow. Prevent bugs, release features more quickly and receive customer feedback earlier.
  build:
    title: build
    header: Build Automation
    body: The first step towards continous deployment. Automate software compilation to reduce deployment costs. Use Docker to run your software in virtual machines, so you can scale quickly and don't have to worry about hardware failure. Catch exceptions automatically, so your developers can learn about bugs when they happen. Use containers to scale up your online service in minutes instead of days. Use a single environment for develop, test en production - no more suprises. Easily connect to hundreds of services and data centers.
  test:
    title: test
    header: Test Automation
    body: After automating the compilation process, you can do the same for testing. Discover bugs as soon as possible with test automation. Deploy only code which passes all tests. This way, you can guarantee that features will keep on working. With automated tests, programming becomes more fun and productive, since you can make changes to your code with confidence.
  integrate:
    title: integrate
    header: Continuous Integration
    body: Instead of waiting for release day, all developers merge their changes as quickly as possible to the master branch. This merged code is tested automatically. This speeds up software development and enhances stability. By sharing new code as fast as possible, there is minimal friction (and merge conflicts) in your development team.
  deliver:
    title: deliver
    header: Continuous Delivery
    body: Releasing a new version becomes as easy as pressing a button. The road from idea to realized feature is shorter than ever. A short value cycle is valuable for you and for your customers.
  deploy:
    title: deploy
    header: Continuous Deployment
    body: Releasing a new version is fully automated. Changes to code trigger a process that builds your software, tests it and releases it if it passes. Now your value cycle is even shorter.
  us:
    header: How we can help
    body: We can offer advice and consultancy to improve your software development workflow. We look at your stack and deployment process, and give advice on how to improve it. We can realize these improvemnts by ourselves, or we can train development teams to make their workflow more efficient.
