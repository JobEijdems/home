The [Solid project](https://solidproject.org/) aims te redefine how data is shared on the web.
It's an initiative by the inventor of the World Wide Web (and Linked Data): Tim Berner-Lee.

Solid has a couple of goals:

- **Give peolpe more control over their data**. With Solid, most of your data will live in your own _pod_, which is a personal server that could run in the cloud, or perhaps in your home.
- **Make apps more interoperable**. Break free from the data-silos and vendor lock-in that currently dominate our cloud-based apps. Since apps decouples data from application, you can use various apps on the same data, just like you can open a text file in multiple editors. This requires a high degree of standardization
- **Build upon existing web standards**. Solid is powered by Linked Data, and uses many existing web standards like HTTP, RDF and SPARQL.

## Ontola & Solid

As a company that has a strong focus on linked data, we've been involved with the Solid project for a couple of years now.
We've worked with Tim Berners-Lee himself on the RDFlib library, and we're currently building a Solid Server called the DexPod, soon to be open sourced.
In 2021, we'll be spending most of our time working on Solid related tech:

- Add full-text search to Solid (financed by [NLNet](https://nlnet.nl/project/Solid-Search/)). The aim is to [make it compatible](https://github.com/solid/community-server/issues/275) with most of the Solid servers.
- Enable web-payments in Solid, so people can easily monetize their data. Financed by [Grant for the Web](https://www.grantfortheweb.org/grantees).
- Continue development on the DexPod
- Create tutorials to help developers getting started with Solid.
- Integrate Solid with our [Argu](https://argu.co/) e-democracy platform
