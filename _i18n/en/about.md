Ontola is a software development company that specializes in web applications, SAAS development and linked data.
We love innovation, open data en technology.

As a team we're working on the e-democracy platform [Argu](https://argu.co), which is used by many organizations to get people engaged in decision-making processes.
We're also responsible for the technology of the [Open Raadsinformatie](https://openraadsinformatie.nl) project, which aims to turn all Dutch governmental meeting minutes and decisions into linked open data.

We love Open Source, so make sure to check out our projects on [Github](http://github.com/ontola/)!
