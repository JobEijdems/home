Ontola is a software development company that specializes in web applications, SAAS development and linked data.
We love innovation, open data en technology.
It's our mission to give people more control over their data, and to make it easier to reuse data.

As a team we're working on the e-democracy platform [Argu](https://argu.co), which is used by many organizations to get people engaged in decision-making processes.
We're also responsible for the technology of the [Open Besluitvorming](https://openbesluitvorming.nl) project, which aims to turn all Dutch governmental meeting minutes and decisions into linked open data.
We're currently working with [Inrupt](http://inrupt.com/) on the [Solid](https://solid.mit.edu) project.

We love Open Source, so make sure to check out our projects on [Github](http://github.com/ontola/)!
