  <p>In this article, we’ll discuss how linked data can make surveys more easy to manage, increase response rates using rewards, create new benefits for users and more.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why it’s important to improve survey interoperability</li>
  <li>How we could increase interoperability using linked data</li>
  <li>How we can use rewards to increase respondent rates for surveys</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-we-need-survey-interoperability">Why we need Survey interoperability</h2>

<p>Surveys are a pretty interesting and complex type of data model.
You can think of a Survey as describing three concepts at once:</p>

<ol>
  <li>a data schema / model (datatypes, required fields, etc.)</li>
  <li>a UI (the questions show to the user)</li>
  <li>and a customer journey (the sequence of questions, sometimes with conditional paths).</li>
</ol>

<p>Due to this complexity, it should not be a big surprise that there are many approaches to creating a Survey, and this has contributed to the low degree of interoperability of surveys.</p>

<p>That’s a shame, because having interoperable Surveys would be <em>really cool</em>!</p>

<ul>
  <li>It would be easier for researchers to <strong>standardize how questions are asked</strong>. For example, many medical surveys are highly standardized, up to how specific words can be used. You can probably imagine how a small change in phrasing a question or answer could have a serious impact on average results. If we standardize surveys and their questions on a data level, researchers could simply import an existing survey, instead of going through the time consuming process of manually creating every single field in their survey software.</li>
  <li>Respondents could have more <strong>freedom in chooing a UI</strong>. Not all user interfaces are easily accessible, pretty, or fun to use. People can have vastly different preferences regarding how a survey should be filled in. If we standardize how Survey Data is structured, we can let respondents pick their own front-end, similar to how you can open a webpage in any webbrowser that you like.</li>
  <li>We could <strong>auto-fill</strong> data from a personal source, which makes entering data less tedious. Browsers already do this for addresses and credit cards, but we can extend this <em>way</em> further by using links! We’ll get to that later</li>
  <li>We can <strong>improve insights in ourselves</strong> by storing and then analyzing data that we filled in in a survey. For example, filling in a survey about how your shortness of breath linked to air pollution has been today could be used in a different app to make a graph that visualizes how your shortness of breath has progressed over the months for personal insight.</li>
</ul>

<p>Achieving these last two steps requires a high degree of standardization in both the surveys and the responses. The survey and its questions should provide information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>question</strong> itself. This is required in all survey questions, of course.</li>
  <li>The <strong>required datatype</strong> of the response, such as ‘string’, or ‘datetime’ or some ‘enumeration’.</li>
  <li>A (link to a) <strong>semantic definition</strong> of the property being described. This is a bit more obscure: all pieces of linked data use links, instead of keys, to describe the relation between some resource and its property. For example, a normal resource might have a ‘birthdate’, while in linked data, we’d use ‘https://schema.org/birthDate’. This semantic definition makes things easier to share, because it prevents misinterpretation. Links remove ambiguity.</li>
  <li>A <strong>query description</strong>. This is even more obscure, but perhaps the most interesting. A query description means describing how a piece of information can be retrieved. Perhaps a question in a survey will want to know what your payment pointer is. If a piece of software wants to auto-fill this field, it needs to know where it can find your payment pointer.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="making-surveys-interoperable">Making surveys interoperable</h2>

<p>A good place to start standardizing, is to use <em>links</em> everywhere. Use links for Properties, use links as identifiers for Surveys, for Responses, for Questions…
Links are great, because they can be <em>opened</em>.
Read my article on <a href="https://ontola.io/what-is-linked-data">Linked Data</a> if this is new to you.</p>

<p>Okay, so we standardize the Questions, Surveys and Responses using links. But which links? And how?
At Ontola, we’ve been building dynamic RDF based forms for our <a href="https://argu.co">Argu.co</a> e-democracy application.
We started out by using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/">W3C SHACL specification</a>, which is a linked data standard for describing data models.
It turned out to be a great first step, as it ticked the first box of concepts in surveys: it describes the <em>schema</em>.
But we still have two concepts left to define: the <em>UI</em> and the <em>Journey</em>.
For example, the SHACL spec does not provide UI concepts for describing whether to use a <em>radio select</em> or a <em>dropdown</em>, or how to render a <em>helper text</em>.
And the <em>Journey</em> should include conditional paths, which is also not possible.
These conditions are also important when the <em>rights</em> of a user determines whether that user can edit a certain field.
We could either calculate all the form fields dynamically, or we could let the front-end use conditional fields to determine which fields are shown.
We opted for the latter, as this resulted in better performance.</p>

<p>So we’re currently working on a Form ontology which adds things like <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pages</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Groups</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">helper text</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Conditions</code>.
As this is still prone to changes and under-specified, we’d rather not share it in its current form, but we do aim to do this in the near future.
An open-source implementation of our Survey software can be found on <a href="https://gitlab.com/ontola/linked-surveys">Gitlab</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rewarding-responses">Rewarding responses</h2>

<p>Filling in a survey isn’t the most fun thing to do, so getting people to fill in a survey can be a challenge.
That’s why it’s pretty common these days to see surveys that promise a chance to win rewards like nice gadgets (iPads, mostly) or coupons.
The first problem with this approach is that the one filling in the survey doesn’t have a clear estimate of what their chances of winning are, which makes the deal a bit less attractive.
The second problem is that it requires the respondent to provide privacy sensitive details, such as address.
A third problem is that not everybody wants an iPad - money is often a bit more attractive.
Ideally, we’d provide a clear and transparent reward, and do so in an anonymous fashion.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago, we discovered the Grant for the Web, a grant that aims to change how we do payments on the internet.
We submitted a proposal to implement a solution for the problems stated above: we wanted to build a service that sends a payment to people who completed a survey.
Because we wanted to provide a high degree of privacy, we wanted our own services to be completely unaware of the payment address of the receiver.
We also wanted to make this project re-usable for other usages (other survey tools, or totally different things).
We therefore up building an open source service, called <a href="https://gitlab.com/ontola/cashlink"><strong>cashlink</strong></a>.
It works like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create unique links (hence <em>cashlink</em>) which encode the value of the link. These can be used only once.</li>
  <li>Share this unique URL in some application, such as at the end of a survey.</li>
  <li>When the user opens this URL, they can submit their own <em>Payment Pointer</em>, which is an open specification for payment addresses built for the web.</li>
  <li>After submitting this, the payment is sent by the cashlink service.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Having a higher degree of standardization can offer various benefits: more standardized research, auto fill forms, UI freedom, and get more insights in our own personal data</li>
  <li>Linked Data can be used to facilitate this standardization process, but we need more (well-documented) standards to do this.</li>
  <li>Payments can be an effective tool for getting more people to fill in surveys.</li>
</ul>
